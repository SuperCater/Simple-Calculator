# IMPORTANT
The code has just recently been rewritten so quite a couple of features are missing and probably won't be brought back.

# Simple-Calculator
A simple calculator that can use multiple types of operations and accepts infinite values (or well till the program runs out of memory)

# How to run:
1. Open your chosen command prompt
2. Change directory to SimpleCalculator
3. type npm run calculate [type] [...values]
4. If you want to access options go to simplecalculator/src/options.js and change the options to true or false.

This project is a simple calculator that has multiple types of operation such as:
  * Addition
  * Subtraction
  * Multiplication
  * Division
  * Exponential
  * Remainder
  # Tax
