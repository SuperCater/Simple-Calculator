# SimpleCalculator

Welcome to the desktop version of simpleCalculator. This is a version of SimpleCalculator that uses a GUI instead of the CLI. This project is being built using the Electron framework and Javascript. This is in heavy development so expect broken stuff, messy UI, failed calculations, errors. If you see any of this please let me know so I can try to fix it.

# Contributing
If you wish to contribute (which I would heavily appreciate.) simply fork it and make a pull request. I will review it and probably merge it.

The project is made using the Electron framework and is written in JavaScript. The UI is made using HTML and CSS (which i am not very good at.)
